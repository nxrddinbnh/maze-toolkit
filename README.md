## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Maze Toolkit is a collection of C++ programs designed to generate, visualize, and solve mazes. Whether you're interested in exploring maze generation algorithms or testing your skills in maze solving, Maze Toolkit has got you covered.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting-started"></a>
To get started with Maze Toolkit, you have two options:

__Download the Executable:__ Simply download the executable file from `public/maze-toolkit.exe` and run it on your local machine.

__Manual Setup:__
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-toolkit.git
```
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
3. Navigate to the src directory.
4. Compile the source files using your preferred compiler.
5. Run the executable to start using Maze Toolkit.

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
Once you've compiled and run the executable, you'll be prompted to choose a maze generation algorithm and specify the dimensions of the maze. After generating the maze, you'll have the option to solve it manually or let Maze Toolkit solve it for you.

## 🛠️ Algorithm Options <a name = "algorithm-options"></a>
Maze Toolkit offers the following maze generation algorithms:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## 🚀 Future Updates <a name = "future-updates"></a>
In future updates, I plan to add more maze generation algorithms to Maze Toolkit, including:
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Recursive Division

Stay tuned for these exciting additions!
