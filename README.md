### Introduction
Maze Toolkit is a collection of C++ programs designed to generate, visualize, and solve mazes. Whether you're interested in exploring maze generation algorithms or testing your skills in maze solving, Maze Toolkit has got you covered.

### Getting Started
To get started with Maze Toolkit, you have two options:

1. Download the Executable: Simply download the executable file from `/public/maze-toolkit.exe` and run it on your local machine.

2. Manual Setup:
    - Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-toolkit.git`
    - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
    - Navigate to the src directory.
    - Compile the source files using your preferred compiler.
    - Run the executable to start using Maze Toolkit.

### Usage
Once you've compiled and run the executable, you'll be prompted to choose a maze generation algorithm and specify the dimensions of the maze. After generating the maze, you'll have the option to solve it manually or let Maze Toolkit solve it for you.

### Algorithm Options
Maze Toolkit offers the following maze generation algorithms:
